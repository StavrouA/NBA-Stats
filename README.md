The purpose of this document is to implement some basic Machine Learning classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, classification trees and support vector machines. We will check the accuracy of these algorithms without tuning them (for example, there was no test (e.g. Elbow method) ran for the selection of the number of k folds in k fold cross validation algorithm, I arbitrarily used k=10), and in the end, we will compare this accuracy to the one that we get from randomly guessing the outcome.
